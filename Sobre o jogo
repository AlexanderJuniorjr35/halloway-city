### Interactive Adventure Game Overview

This is an engaging interactive adventure game that challenges players to make critical decisions in a dark and mysterious world. The goal is to survive and escape dangerous situations, facing terrifying creatures and enigmatic challenges. With each step, players are immersed in a captivating narrative full of surprises and twists.

#### Introduction and Premise
At the start of the game, players are greeted by an intriguing message: "You are about to start a game you should not start!" With a sinister atmosphere established from the beginning, players are prompted to accept the game’s terms, presented in both Portuguese and Russian. Accepting the terms is the first crucial choice, setting the tone for the adventure ahead.

#### Choices and Consequences
The game offers players three distinct paths to choose from, each leading to different scenarios and challenges. The game’s structure heavily relies on player choices, with each decision leading to new story branches:

1. **Path 1: The Dark Cave**
    - The player can choose to enter the dark cave or follow the road beside it. Both choices lead to tragic endings, with the cave harboring a fierce predator and the road ending in an abyss, where the player falls into despair.

2. **Path 2: The Mysterious Portal**
    - This path presents a mysterious portal that the player can choose to enter or ignore. Entering the portal leads to an encounter with a witch who offers a pact. Accepting or rejecting the pact opens up new possibilities, including a meeting with Mortiferoth, the Soul Devourer, and the chance to negotiate an escape. Ignoring the portal results in an eternal curse.

3. **Path 3: Dracus, the Awakening of Darkness**
    - The player encounters Dracus and must decide between searching for magical artifacts around or approaching Dracus. Searching for artifacts results in finding an item that kills Dracus and allows a return home. Approaching Dracus, however, leads to eternal condemnation in darkness.

#### Game Mechanics
The game uses simple commands to navigate through choices, with clear instructions on how to proceed in each situation. The use of a terminal-clearing function after each choice helps maintain player immersion and narrative clarity. Timed pauses between events increase tension and anticipation.

#### Restart and Replayability
After a conclusion, whether successful or tragic, players have the option to restart the game and try different paths and choices. This not only enhances replayability but also allows players to explore all possible outcomes and endings.

#### Conclusion
This interactive adventure game offers an exciting and challenging experience where every choice matters. With a rich and immersive narrative, players are transported to a world full of dangers and mysteries, where only the most astute can survive. Test your courage and intelligence in this unique game and see if you have what it takes to escape alive!
